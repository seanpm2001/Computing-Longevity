# Why is 32 bit software not compliant?

32 bit support is not compliant, as it fails on the compliance for time and date, since a 32 bit system has a maximum of ~10000 years. Although this won't affect the current generation too much, one of the compliance goals requires software to work indefinitely, and since 64 bit software has a maximum of 18446744073709551616 seconds (or 5.04009400921026e+16 years/seconds) 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (18.44 Quintillion seconds) there are 86,400 seconds in a day, 604,800 seconds in a week, 31,622,400 seconds in a leap year, 3,162,240,000 seconds in a century, and so on (my calculator can't keep up with the exact answer.

32 bit software ends much earlier, for example, in UNIX; a 32 bit date can only reach January 19th 2038 (range: 1970 January 1st to 2038 January 19th) this is commonly known as the [Y2K38 bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) the limit is much, much higher under 64 bit software, and is estimated to last longer than the sun in our galaxy (The Milky Way) which means it will last at least 4 billion years.

## Conclusion

64 bit and 128 bit software passes the test on this case, as long as it isn't programmed in to fail after a certain date.
